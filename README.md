### 30 Days of Code Challenge Results

## Overview
This document contains my progress and solutions from the **30 Days of Code Challenge**.  
Each day focuses on a new programming concept, building up from basics to more advanced problem-solving skills.

## Reflection
- **Consistency pays off**: coding every day improved my fluency.  
- **Stronger fundamentals**: arrays, dictionaries, and recursion became more natural.  
- **Next step**: continue with more advanced problems and practice optimization.
